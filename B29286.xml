            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Citizens and Tradesmens Case:</hi> Humbly to be Presented to the Ensuing Parliament, relating to the Price of Corn, by several Citizens and Tradesmen of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have chosen a King who hath taken from us our Fears and Jealousies of Popery and Slavery at home, and ventur'd his Royal Person to defend us from our Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and in his absence left Lords Justices, who have taken notice of the Distress the Poor labour under, by the Excessive Price of Corn, and have Issued forth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and order to suppress the Causes thereof; And we still enjoy our Ancient liberty to Choose our Representatives who are shortly to sit, to hear the Peoples Grievances and Redress them, and if we have chosen such as do not, it's our own fault: No doubt, but they will at this time hear the Cry of the Poor for Bread, and not let them Perish amidst Gods abounding mercies.</p>
            <p>Food and Raiment is the support of mankind, (the greatest of Men Enjoy no more.) And God hath seated us in a Land of <hi>Goshen</hi> which abounds in both, and by the Manufactory thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Maintenance for the Poor, and to augment our Happiness, we have been hitherto a Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People, Inabled by our Ships and Seamen to out-do our Neighbours, and by which our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants by Trading abroad, and our Mechanicks and Tradesmen at home have gotten Riches, whereby our Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> hath hitherto been able to assist our Prince, to defend us from our Envious Enemies both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>Trade and Industry beget Riches, and Riches (with Gods Blessing) is the Glory of this World, and is that, which made the Poor distressed States of <hi>Holland,</hi> High and Mighty, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Mogan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the whip for the Mealman, Forestallers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Published by <hi>A. Baldwin</hi> in <hi>Warwick-Lane,</hi> I set forth some Reasons of the present Dearness of Corn, which by wise men hath been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; and some discreet Citizens and Tradesmen of <hi>London,</hi> being sensible of the decay of their substance, by bad Trade and Dearness of Corn, have desired me to give my further thoughts herein (that they, together with their Brethren in City and Country, may pray for a redress) which I shall endeavour to do by further Demonstrating other Causes thereof, then what I have set forth, which of it self will Answer Objections, that some Person may make; and shew the remedies thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forestallers, Regrators,</hi> and <hi>Ingrossers</hi> of Corn, do not only buy Corn on the Ground, at the Farmers Houses, and at Inns, but themselves, or Factors have a strict watch upon the markets; And when the Labouring Farmer brings forth his Corn to sell plentifully to pay his Rent, or to supply his necessary occasions, then the <hi>Ingrossers, &amp;c.</hi> Buy up the Corn, and when the Poor Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Corn is out, then these unmerciful Men raise the price at their pleasure, and tho there may be some plentiful markets, Yet there is never so many together, that will fall the price of Bread in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not against such as (<hi>Joseph</hi> like) do preserve Corn in a plenty, against the time of scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; It's as good for the Poor as for the Farmer, and pleasant to see such plenty of Corn in the Farmers Yards, when it's kept only for the Markets.</p>
            <p>Another Reason of the Dearness of Corn is the Transporting of it, and that mostly in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign bottoms, which other Nations also have, for fear of War and Scarcity, forbid the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting thereof. And it's generally reported, that there is some Hundred Thousand Pounds transmitted in Bills to <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi> to buy up our Corn; Especially in the <hi>West,</hi> where there hath been a plentiful Harvest. I remember a Story of a <hi>French</hi> Admiral, who sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to Factors in <hi>Poland,</hi> to buy Corn to Victual his Fleet, by which they bought up so much (the Poor Farmers being glad to receive ready Money) that it made Corn so scarce and dear, that the People of the Country were forced to buy again of the Factors, at double the rate they had paid for it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:198865:2"/>
            <p>Another Reason of the Dearness of Corn is occasioned by the Distillers, which some are so confident as to aver, that they consume as such Malt in some places as the Brewers, but as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out of my knowledge, so I dare not meddle with it, neither do I know how it stands in the Kings Books. But this I know, that Barly in a scarce Year, (sellers being forced by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates care to serve the poor therewith for Bread before the Maulsters bought in the Market) greatly preserved the Poor, and what with the Excise on Beer, and Tax on Mault, Barly, in some places is near as dear as Wheat, which hath brought Mault to an Excessive rate; Insomuch, that it hath caused the Brewen to raise the price of Beer, that it's like to ruin the poor Retailers. And beer being such a succour to poor Labouring Men, that I pray God it may not cause a Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour amongst the People; and the drinking of strong Waters, causes the Poor to spend the more easily what their Families want, and Impair, their Health. And it's worthy of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the abominable practice of <hi>Distill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi> in using Mault made of Wheat.</p>
            <p>The greatest Objection that the Farmers make, and which the Poor fear will be to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) is, the Farmers say, that if the Laws are put in Execution against Forestallers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will thereby lower the price of Corn, and make the Landlords Rents to fall.</p>
            <p>This is that which in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time (Corn being then cheap) caused the Act to pass against bringing in <hi>Irish</hi> Cattle; which in time of War and Scarcity, the poor Handycrafts Men have much wanted: And now if the Price of Corn and other Provisions do not fall, and the Tradesmen able to work as cheap as in other Nations, (that have more plenty of Provisions) we shall lose our Trade, and the poor Handycraftmen must leave the Country or starve. And so this Objection is only to amuse the World, and to affright the Landlords; for the Ingrossing of Farms, will in time be as great a prejudice to the Landlords, as the Dearness of Corn is to the Poor, for in many places, Rich Farmers have now Ingrossed so many Farms into their hands, that they have much Depopulated the Parishes where they live, having drove away the working Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants (who would pay their Rents well and be at the Landlords command) let fall the Farm Houses, lose the Kings Window Tax, and have the Landlord at command, by being tied to one Tenant; For to my own knowledge, a Person of Honour in the <hi>West</hi> Depopulated a Parish to his great loss. Whereas the worthy Sir <hi>John Strangeways,</hi> made his Servants good Husbands to save their Wages, and lent them Money to enable them to Farm, and thereby increased his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and made them serviceable to himself and Country, and are at this Day Men of repute.</p>
            <p>How to cure so long growing and profitable a corruption, is too hard a task for my poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the more considering how many Persons have already been stigmatized in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, with the odious Name of Informers, ruined in their substance and in danger of their lives for discovering Frauds and Cheats; And tho those that wrong'd the King and got great Estates thereby, yet have they gone unpunished, which does so discourage Men that they, dare not meddle with such rich offenders.</p>
            <p>As to the great out-cry there is against Corn Meeters, and the Actions of <hi>Bear-Key</hi> (judged to be through the neglect of the City Officers, who buy their places, and mind only their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit) which relates to the City, the wise Heads in their Councils can best order, and no Question the next Lord Mayor will be as Zealous in assisting the Poor, in puting these wholesom Laws in Execution to keep them from starving, as this present Lord Mayor hath been in punishing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>Our Ancestors have left us good Laws and Remedies, against this foul distemper of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling, Ingrossing and Transporting of Corn; Our Lords Justices have Issued out a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and order thereupon to prevent both. The Magistrates have full Power and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Act in it, and the Laws already made hath given so great a Power to the Justice of the Peace, that it will look as if it were their fault if the Laws be not put in Execution, but if they want power to make a full cure of this Distemper, we have a Parliament suddenly to sit, and persons ready to pray for their assistance, which no doubt will give it them, if wanting, and they desire it; and the people, by the Act, may prosecute such that in 2 Years past have been guilty of Forestalling, Transporting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there has been an instance seen lately, of the good effect of the Prosecuting of offenders, by the Lutestring Company, that put the Law in Execution against such as Imported <hi>French</hi> Goods, tending to the destruction of the <hi>Allamode</hi> Pattent; and carried on by a Rich Man, who did not value the By-Name of an Informer, whereby the offenders were punished, and that distemper to appearance cured. I wish all that have cheated the King and Country, and Transgress the Law may be so served, then the King would have more Money, the People fewer Taxes, and the Poor more bread, and all Men cause to praise God for having such good Laws and Good Magistrates.</p>
